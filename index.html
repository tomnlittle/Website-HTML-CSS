                    <p>
                        I have been intensely interested in computers and engineering from a young age, and have
                        competed in several computer science and engineering competitions throughout my life. <br>
                        I first began to experiment with basic programming or scripting around the ages of 11 and 12, 
                        where I started to write mini programs in Bash and the windows command line. By age 12 I had started to 
                        learn Ruby and continued to work with it throughout high school. <br>
                        At the age of 15 I began to experiment with JAVA, and the realm of object oriented programming. 
                        With the aid of Minecraft, I furthered my abilities by creating a considerable modification to the game, 
                        adding in my own characters, AI, environments and weapons. <br>
                        In High School, as part of the curriculum I studied python and HTML/CSS. I competed in a number of Computing 
                        Competitions and scored highly in the NCSS challenge. <br>
                        I am currently working on a couple of projects, such as a drone controlled from Raspberry Pi. 
                        I found during my first year of University that COMP2121 greatly interested me, it was a course which 
                        mainly focused on microcontrollers and how they are used; it covered in depth assembly programming, interrupts and control systems.
                        In Semester 1 of 2017, I will continue my studies at UNSW, where I have enrolled in the Artificial Intelligence, 
                        Operating Systems, and Computing for Engineers Courses; as well as Discrete Maths. <br>
