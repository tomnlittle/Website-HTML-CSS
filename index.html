    <h1> About </h1>
    <p> 
        I have had a passion for fixing, breaking and making new things since I was very little. With little physical resources 
        as a child I found that programming and computing offered a lot to work with. Software is free right ? 
    <br><br>
        So began my obsession with programming, which later grew into little projects which I would do alongside my school work. 
        Around the age of 14 I started working with the Java programming language and constructed a modification to the game Minecraft,
        called Mo' Minecraft. The game addon added a lot to the game, such as new weapons, biomes, enemies and items; and it was 
        fairly successful with around 15 000 downloads online. 
    <br><br> 
        As my curiosity grew, so did my projects; and as I began to finish my HSC I started to invest more time into my PiDrone.
        The project was originally written in python and worked via voice command, the drone would take off and land with my voice.
        However as stability began to become a problem, especially outside, the pi and python began to noticeably lag when calculating
        PI system. Hence, now after a year of university I am rewriting the whole thing in C++, and am now using a newer raspberry pi.
